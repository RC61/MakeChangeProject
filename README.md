### Lessons Learned
I learned that you should always keep track of the changes you are making. It is always good to leave a trail behind
if only to show where your head was at. 

I also have learned that the best way to build and test code is in small increments.

I'm sure my code is bloated at around 175-180 lines of code but i am excited to see how i can do better on Monday.
